# Why Coding Laboratory?

## This not for general audience

This expands the club's horizon to intermediate/experienced programmers

## Not a typical "Laboratory"

Not the kind of lab you think of right know. A Place where One can start a career in programming.
A Place where One can engage with other people to form a community / peer group.
A Place to show what you know and to learn what others know.

## Recognition to small projects 

Everyone here was once a beginner, during those times we wouldn't have the knowledge to actually work on a large project. We all started with small projects but then, we don't actually use them anymore as we started building larger projects. 

So the idea can include those small projects into the mix, which will be a driving force for the beginners to start contributing to smaller projects or if they are already working on projects a platform to recognize those projects as well. A perfect platorm for those who are starting to contribute and those who are already contributing to open source.

To put the same idea in another way might be, Not most of us, even if we want to work with a community and contribute to it we won't actually do that. One of many reasons maybe the project might be too large for us to consume that it does and many more like that. We can start with small projects, one baby step at a time towards contributing. A Place to start and to continue endlessly

## Exposure to lot of streams

When students are openly exposed to a marketplace where they clearly know what are their friends' expertise, they can also adapt a lot other streams 


## Unfair benefits for Core members of the club

Being an administrative/core member of various clubs, We have realised that all the core members gain the space to develop their soft skills ( leadership qualities, administration, speaking ), but they couldn't actually develop the technical skills intensively, for those skills being the ones that let them to their respective current positions.

## Implement and Learn

Implementation / Learning of Algorithms in various Research Papers ( Idea : SaiKrishna )

## Powerful Community

* First College-based Open Source Community in India.
* A Powerful Open Source Community can achieve greater heights.
* An Example would be Julia, the Open Source Programming Language for Scentific Computing. One of its kind, used intensively in many areas of research testing.
